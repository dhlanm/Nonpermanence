# Nonpermanence
An artist gets a tile to work with. They can make something in that tile. Once they are done, they can no longer edit the tile.
Do they get to choose what tile they want? Maybe they can influence it a bit but it should be random.

I’m imagining a ‘main screen’ display, showing a combined view of all tiles
Maybe while you are editing your tile you can see adjacent tiles (but not draw in them)

When all tiles have been filled? IDK, maybe you can draw over other people's tiles?

There should be no eraser because erasing is for the weak

Whole board is cleared after some period of time
